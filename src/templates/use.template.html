<h2>How to Use This App</h2>

<div class="long-text">

<p>This app was built to give students instant feedback as they practice Roman numerals. Here are a few ways to use this app inside and outside the classroom.</p>

<ol>
  <li> Give students 5-10 minutes to individually practice Roman numerals with the app. This can also be a backup activity if you have a spare 5-10 minutes left over in class.</li>
  <br/>

  <li>For added excitement, make it a competition to see which student (or group of students) can get the most correct answers in a certain amount of time. The "History" page shows the number of correct answers at top of the page.</li>
  <br/>

  <li> Project the random numbers generated by the app, and have students race to write the correct answer on mini-whiteboards. You don't even have to check their work: they can check it themselves once you press "Check Answer" and the correct answer is projected to the class.</li>
  <br/>

  <li> Assign students to do a set number of practice problems for homework (and maybe get a certain number correct). They can email you their history by screenshotting it or copying and pasting it to prove they've completed the assignment. If you're not grading for correctness, you'll also be able to see if they put in an effort or just typed in gibberish.</li>
</ol>

<p>N.B. Make sure that students know that all their work will be lost if they refresh the page -- but they can also get a fresh start by refreshing if they're doing poorly.</p>
