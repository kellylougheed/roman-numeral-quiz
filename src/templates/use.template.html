<h2>How to Use This App</h2>

<p>This app was built to give students instant feedback as they practice Roman numerals. Here are a few ways to use this app inside and outside the classroom.</p>

<ol>
  <li> Give students 5-10 minutes to individually practice Roman numerals with the app. This can also be a backup activity if you have a spare 5-10 minutes left over in class. For added excitement, make it a competition to see which student (or group of students) can get the most correct answers in a certain amount of time. The "History" page shows the number of correct answers at top of the page.</li>

  <li> Project the random numbers generated by the app, and have students race to write the correct answer on mini-whiteboards. You don't even have to check their work: they can check it themselves once you press "Check Answer" and the correct answer is projected to the class.</li>

  <li> Assign students to do a set number of practice problems for homework (and maybe get a certain number correct). They can print out or screenshot and email you their history to prove they've completed the assignment (and you can see whether they've typed in gibberish or not). Make sure that students know that all their work will be lost if they refresh the page -- but they can also get a fresh start by refreshing if they're doing poorly.</li>
</ol>
